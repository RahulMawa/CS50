# CS50: By Harvard University

In 2020 and 2021, I spent a chunk of my spare time into learning various languages that would help me with my pursuit in being a Data Scientist. So, I enrolled into the online course that Harvard offers, which trained me to become a 'Good Developer'.

This repository is a collection of all the problem set solutions I have programmed over the years.

^Note: 
The first course is 'CS50: An Introduction to Computer Science', and the second course is 'CS50: An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence'.
