        <h1 class="header"><strong>MY VISION:</strong></h1>
        <p class= "body">I strongly believe that the future of our planet seems to get tougher with every passing decade as our resources stay finite
        and the human population stays ever growing. The only solution is for the human race to adapt to a more sustainable lifestyle,
        which can only come to a reality with the intorduction to machine learning and aritificial intelligence into our daily lives.
        By doing so, we can make new and better systems, and improve the existing systems to be more efficient to do more with lesser
        consumption of energy.</p>

        <p class= "body">I am passionate to one day work on a project that can solve a real life problem using machine learning. For this dream to come
        true, I actively spend significant amount of my time learning various computer languages, and eventually aim to learn more about
        artificial intelligence and neuroscience.</p>
